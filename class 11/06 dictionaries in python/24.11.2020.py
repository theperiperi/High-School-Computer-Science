#in python, dictionaries are written with curly brackets and they have keys and values
#Since it is an unordered collection of values,it is used
#dictionaries are case sensitive, same name but different keys will be treated differently
#Values in a dictionary can be of any data type  and can be duplicated, whereas keys cannot be repeated, they must be immutable
#you can bring list as a part of dictionary, dictionary inside dictionary,etc.
